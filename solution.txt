For the calculation of the page-fault rate that is acceptable according to the ques:
o	If P is the page-fault rate then P is the probability that a memory access causes a page fault
o	If there is no page-fault then the memory access time is 100 nano-seconds
o	Also (1-P) =Q(let) is the probability that the memory access doesn't cause a page-fault
o	Therefore (1-P) is the probability that a memory access costs 100 nano secs
o	The probability that a page fault costs 20 milli-seconds is 0.7*P
o	The probability that a page fault costs 8 milli-seconds is (1-0.7=)0.3*P
o	Since 1 nsec = 10^6 msec and access time should not be more than 200 nano-seconds:
o	[(1-P) *100] + [ 0.7*P*20000000] + [0.3*P*8000000] = 200
o	(14000000 + 2400000 - 100) P = 100
o	P = 100/ (16400100) 
o	P = 6.1 * 10^-6 
o	P = .0000061
o	P = .00061%
This solution uses basic mathematical rules and OS concepts of paging to determine the acceptable value of P i.e. page fault rate
